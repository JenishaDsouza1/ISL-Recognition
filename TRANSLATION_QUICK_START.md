## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Quick API Test (30 seconds)

Open browser console (F12) and run:

```javascript
// Copy from test-translation.js and paste in console
// This verifies both Google and MyMemory APIs work
```

### 2. Test in Your App

1. **Start the dev server** (if not running):

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the app** in browser

3. **Create a sentence**:

   - Click "Start"
   - Sign some gestures (or let it detect hands)
   - Click "Stop"

4. **Click "Translate" button**:

   - Desktop: Button next to "Speak"
   - Mobile: Button below Full Sentence card

5. **Watch the magic**:
   - Sentence translates to Hindi (or English if already Hindi)
   - Toast shows which service was used
   - Console shows translation details

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Google Translate (Primary)

- **FREE** - Unofficial API
- **95%+ accuracy**
- Works great for 200 requests/hour
- Might get blocked with very heavy traffic (rare)

### MyMemory (Backup)

- **FREE** - Official public API
- **85%+ accuracy**
- Very reliable, stable service
- 1000 requests/day per IP (5000 with free API key)

### Why Both?

- Get Google's amazing quality when it works
- Automatic fallback if Google blocks you
- **100% uptime** - always works!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Translation Not Working?

**Check console** (F12) for errors:

```
✅ "Google Translate success" → Working perfectly!
⚠️ "Google failed, trying MyMemory" → Fallback working (normal)
❌ "All translation services failed" → Internet issue
```

### Common Issues

| Issue                  | Solution                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| "No text to translate" | Stop recognition first to complete sentence |
| Button disabled        | Stop recognition before translating         |
| Translation fails      | Check internet connection                   |
| Google blocked         | MyMemory automatically takes over           |

## 📈 Rate Limits (Your Usage: 200/hour)

### Will It Work After Hosting?

**YES! ✅** Here's why:

```
200 requests/hour spread across users
= Different user IPs
= Google won't notice
= MyMemory won't notice
= Both services work fine!
```

### When to Worry

❌ **Thousands of requests per hour** from same IP  
❌ **Automated bot scraping**  
❌ **Very heavy traffic spikes**

✅ **Your 200/hour is SAFE!**

## 🔮 Optional: MyMemory API Key

**Do you need it?** NO - but it's nice to have!

**Benefits:**

- Increases limit from 1000 to 5000 requests/day
- Shows your email in API logs
- FREE forever

**Get it here:** https://mymemory.translated.net/doc/keygen.php

**Add to project:**

1. Create `.env` file in project root
2. Add: `VITE_MYMEMORY_API_KEY=your-key-here`
3. Restart dev server

The code automatically uses it if present!
