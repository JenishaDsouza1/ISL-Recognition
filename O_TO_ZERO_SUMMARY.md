# ✅ 'O' to '0' Conversion - ACTIVE

## 🎯 What Was Changed

Added automatic conversion of letter **'o'** (lowercase) or **'O'** (uppercase) to number **'0'** in two scenarios:

1. ✅ **Standalone 'o' or 'O'** (word by itself)
2. ✅ **'o' or 'O' mixed with numbers**

**Case-insensitive:** Both 'o' and 'O' are converted to '0'!

## 🔧 Files Modified

### ✅ `src/lib/wordCorrection.ts`

**Added function:**

```typescript
export function convertOToZero(text: string): string {
  let result = text.replace(/(\d+)o(\d*)/gi, "$10$2"); // 1o2 → 102
  result = result.replace(/o(\d+)/gi, "0$1"); // o5 → 05
  return result;
}
```

**Updated functions:**

- `correctWord()` - Now calls `convertOToZero()` first
- `correctSentence()` - Now handles standalone 'o' → '0'

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Flow:**

```
Backend sends: "Room 1o1 has o people"
    ↓
Step 1: Replace standalone 'o' → '0'
    "Room 1o1 has 0 people"
    ↓
Step 2: correctWord() for each word
    "1o1" → convertOToZero() → "101"
    ↓
Final: "Room 101 has 0 people" ✅
```

---

## ✅ When It Converts (Case-Insensitive)

### **Scenario 1: Standalone 'o' or 'O'**

```
" o "     → " 0 "
" O "     → " 0 "
"Total o" → "Total 0"
"Total O" → "Total 0"
"o items" → "0 items"
"O items" → "0 items"
```

### **Scenario 2: With Numbers (Any Case)**

```
"1o2"  → "102"
"1O2"  → "102"
"5o5"  → "505"
"5O5"  → "505"
"o5"   → "05"
"O5"   → "05"
"1o"   → "10"
"1O"   → "10"
```

---

## ❌ When It DOESN'T Convert

### **Normal Words (Preserved):**

```
"hello"   → "hello"   ✅ (NOT "hell0")
"good"    → "good"    ✅ (NOT "g00d")
"go"      → "go"      ✅ (NOT "g0")
"on"      → "on"      ✅ (NOT "0n")
"one"     → "one"     ✅ (NOT "0ne")
```

**Why?** Uses word boundaries - only converts standalone 'o' or 'o' with numbers.

## 🧪 Test It Yourself

### **In Your App:**

1. **Start your app:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Sign language gestures for numbers:**

   - Sign: **0** → Should display "0" (not "o")
   - Sign: **1-0-2** → Should display "102" (not "1o2")
   - Sign: **5-0-5** → Should display "505" (not "5o5")

3. **Sign language for words:**
   - Sign: **"hello"** → Should display "hello" (unchanged)
   - Sign: **"go home"** → Should display "go home" (unchanged)

---

## 📝 Test Cases

### **Copy & Test in Browser Console:**

```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and paste:

import { correctSentence } from "./src/lib/wordCorrection";

// Test 1
correctSentence("I have o apples");
// Expected: "I have 0 apples"

// Test 2
correctSentence("Call 5o5-1o23");
// Expected: "Call 505-1023"

// Test 3
correctSentence("Room 1o1 has o people");
// Expected: "Room 101 has 0 people"

// Test 4
correctSentence("hello go home");
// Expected: "hello go home" (unchanged)
```

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

### **Use Case 1: Phone Numbers**

```
User signs: 5-0-5-1-0-2-3
Backend might send: "5o5 1o23"
App displays: "505 1023" ✅
```

### **Use Case 2: Room Numbers**

```
User signs: Room 1-0-1
Backend might send: "Room 1o1"
App displays: "Room 101" ✅
```

### **Use Case 3: Counting**

```
User signs: I have 0 apples
Backend might send: "I have o apples"
App displays: "I have 0 apples" ✅
```

### **Use Case 4: Scores**

```
User signs: My score is 10 out of 10
Backend might send: "My score is 1o out of 1o"
App displays: "My score is 10 out of 10" ✅
```

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### **Regular Expressions Used:**

1. **`/\bo\b/gi`** - Matches standalone 'o'

   - Word boundary → 'o' → Word boundary
   - Case insensitive

2. **`/(\d+)o(\d*)/gi`** - Matches 'o' between numbers

   - Examples: "5o5", "1o", "2o3"

3. **`/o(\d+)/gi`** - Matches 'o' before numbers
   - Examples: "o5", "o123"

---

## 🔄 Where It Runs

### **Automatic - No User Action Needed:**

1. **WebSocket Handler** (Real-time)

   ```typescript
   // File: src/pages/Index.tsx
   ws.onmessage = (ev) => {
     const rawSentence = data.data?.sentence || "";
     const correctedSentence = rawSentence
       .split(" ")
       .map((w) => correctWord(w)) // ← Runs convertOToZero()
       .join(" ");
     setSentence(correctedSentence);
   };
   ```

2. **Grammar Check** (Manual button click)
   ```typescript
   // File: src/lib/grammar.ts
   const finalCorrected = correctSentence(grammarCorrected);
   // ← Also runs 'o' to '0' conversion
   ```

## 🎉 Result

**Your app now automatically converts:**

- Standalone "o" → "0"
- Numbers like "5o5" → "505"
- Mixed like "Room 1o1 has o people" → "Room 101 has 0 people"

**While preserving:**

- Normal words like "hello", "go", "home" (unchanged)

**No configuration needed - it just works!** ✨
