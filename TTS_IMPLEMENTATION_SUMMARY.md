## 🚀 How It Works

### Simple 3-Step Process:

```
1. User finishes signing
   ↓
2. User clicks "Speak" button
   ↓
3. System automatically:
   • Detects language (Hindi/English)
   • Selects best voice
   • Speaks the text
```

### Automatic Language Detection:

| Text Contains                  | Detected Language | Voice Used       |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Only English letters           | English (en-US)   | English voice 🇺🇸 |
| Devanagari characters (नमस्ते) | Hindi (hi-IN)     | Hindi voice 🇮🇳   |
| Mixed (hello नमस्ते)           | Hindi (hi-IN)     | Hindi voice 🇮🇳   |

## 🎨 UI Changes

### Desktop:

**Before:**

```
[Translate] [Speak] ← Placeholder, just shows toast
```

**After:**

```
[Translate] [Speak] ← Actually speaks!
            ↑
            When speaking:
            [🔊 Speaking...] (pulsing icon, disabled)
```

---

### Mobile:

**Before:**

```
[Full Sentence Card]
[Translate] [Speak] ← Placeholder
```

**After:**

            ↑
            When speaking:
            [🔊 Speaking...] (pulsing icon)
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Language Detection Algorithm:

```typescript
export function detectLanguage(text: string): SpeechLanguage {
  // Check for Devanagari Unicode range (Hindi script)
  // Devanagari range: U+0900 to U+097F
  const devanagariRegex = /[\u0900-\u097F]/;

  if (devanagariRegex.test(text)) {
    return "hi-IN"; // Hindi detected
  }

  return "en-US"; // Default to English
}
```

---

### Voice Selection Priority:

```typescript
1. Google voices (e.g., "Google हिन्दी", "Google US English")
   ↓ (if not available)
2. Voices with exact language match (hi-IN, en-US)
   ↓ (if not available)
3. First available voice for that language
```

---

### Speech Synthesis:

```typescript
const speakCurrent = async () => {
  const text = sentence || word || letter;

  // Detect language automatically
  const detectedLang = detectLanguage(text);

  // Speak with detected language
  const result = await speakText(text, detectedLang);

  // Show result
  if (result.success) {
    toast.success(`✅ Spoken in ${langName}`);
  }
};
```
